Appium is an open-source automation framework that provides
[WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)-based automation possibilities for a wide range of
different mobile, desktop and IoT platforms. Appium is modular and extensible, and supports multiple
programming languages, which means there is an entire ecosystem of related software:

As a test developer, it is quite difficult to create a good automated test suite that works on iOS and Android platforms. Both Android and iOS have several different testing frameworks that work well but have nothing to do with each other. Therefore, you need to create and maintain two separate test suites, one for Android and one for iOS. They are also written in different languages and with different development tools (IDEs), so it is difficult to share any code between tests for different platforms, even if the apps work the same way. But this is exactly where Appium comes in. From Appium's own website:

Appium is â€˜cross-platformâ€™: it allows you to write tests against multiple platforms (iOS, Android) using the same API. This enables code reuse between iOS and Android test suites.

- **Java JDK 17 temurin**
